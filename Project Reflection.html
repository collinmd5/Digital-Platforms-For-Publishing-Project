<title>Project Reflection</title>
<body>
To say that I spent a solid hour+ as the conductor of the train-wreck that was me working on this project would be an understatement. As somebody who came from the “Myspace Coding” generation, I truthfully thought that this Github project would be a walk in the park. Needless to say, I was incorrect. I found this assignment to be difficult in the sense that there was a lot of trial and error for me personally — and oftentimes, I would solve the error but not realize how I did it because my memory decided to abandon me on this particular day. I would say the most difficult part was embedding the paragraphs as well as incorporating the image. I also had slight difficulty getting my page to publish (it wouldn’t pass the inspection process for some reason), but that was likely just a site situation. Ultimately, when I click “view site” I see somewhat of a website. I am completely unsure if it was done properly, but the journey lead me to some sort of a final product. While I found this to be incredibly difficult, I also see the point that it can be considered simple. Once you crack the code after a while, it seems that this process will gradually become like more of a second nature. This also gave me a different sort of respect for digital publishing as I never really considered the structure that goes behind it all. I suppose I expected the more difficult parts to be in the content itself – but the entirety of it all is a production, or an art.
